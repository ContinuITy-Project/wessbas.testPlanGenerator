The "m4jdsl.ecore" file has been included to this folder for opening the
contained M4J-DSL models (.xmi-files) in the EMF Form Editor, by simply
double-clicking them in Eclipse; that file is just a copy of the M4J-DSL
meta-model definition in the "net.sf.markov4jmeter.m4jdsl" project's model
folder.
